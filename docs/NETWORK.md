# Network

Our project uses IPv6 (TCP/IP) stack for connectivity between nodes and connectivity to our server which handles most of the data.



## Simple Architecture

- Border Router [Setting up border router](https://github.com/KRVPerera/sense/wiki/Setting-up-border-router)

- Network availability for sensor node

- CoAP protocol



## CoAP protocol for application layer

- We send each in ´Confirmable´ mode
